##### reducing mental fatigue:
1. stick to a schedule (fewer decisions)
2. nature (outside)
3. exercise (walking is particularly associated with creativity)
4. wanting to do a preferred task 9e.g. watch television)
5. engaging a different part of brain


##### Github steps (repository from scratch)
// 1. [git clone] to copy a remote directory (e.g. from Github to local machine)
// 2. [git pull] - synchronises the 'local' repo with 'remote' repo (in case someone else hsa modified the remote repo)
// 3. [git add] add files to be 'tracked' by the git
// 4. [git push] - push changes to remote repository
// 5. [git branch] - 

##### TODOs:
DONE Put 'Pair' class into header and implementation files
DONE Move 'friend' function definition out of main
DONE Add compilation script into makefile
DONE fix string compilation warnings
- link C++_Training folder with github
