#### Daily revision tasks:

DONE - pointers ( '&', '*', pass-by-reference, pointer arithmetic, smart pointers)
		chapters: 9, 13

2 - classes (inheritence, polymorphism, destructors, copy constructors, virtual functions)
		chapters: 10, 15

3 - github (pull requests, local vs remote commits, ...

4 - file I/O

5 - networking (e.g. TCP/IP packets, ping)

6 - Libraries (boost, dynamic vs static libs, )

7 - makefiles ('Make' is a software tool that uses its own macro-based language )
			- split files into main(), .h and .cpp files for each class .... 

8 - templates

##### reducing mental fatigue:
1. stick to a schedule (fewer decisions)
2. nature (outside)
3. exercise (walking is particularly associated with creativity)
4. wanting to do a preferred task 9e.g. watch television)
5. engaging a different part of brain


##### Github steps (repository from scratch)
// 1. [git clone] to copy a remote directory (e.g. from Github to local machine)
// 2. [git pull] - synchronises the 'local' repo with 'remote' repo (in case someone else hsa modified the remote repo)
// 3. [git add] add files to be 'tracked' by the git
// 4. [git commit] -locally commits changes
// 5. [git push] - push changes to remote repository
// 6. [git branch] - 

##### TODOs:
DONE Put 'Pair' class into header and implementation files
DONE Move 'friend' function definition out of main
DONE Add compilation script into makefile
DONE 修 string compilation warnings
DONE link C++_Training folder with github
DONE create class 'shape' with child classes 'square' and 'circle'. Use inherited methods, correct file structure. 
DONE link boost library with project and makefile
DONE split makefile into 'files', 'output' and 'search' lines
DONE make 'Shape' an abstract class
DONE handle the exceptions incorrect function output
DONE programming project 16.1 (handling exceptions)
DONE practice program 18.4 (std::map template) + read in data from file
DONE create a static library (for 'string methods' e.g. split), add makefile lines to build this library, then build the project with them
DONE modify the strig library to work using the namespace 'burrough' e.g. burrough::sort()
DONE 练习 program 17.2 (templates)
DONE PP 18.3 (dequeue)
DONE PP 9.7 (dynamic arrays)
- put stringlib changes in new github branch
